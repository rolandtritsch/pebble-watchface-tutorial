# My Pebble Watchface Tutorial (C)

This extends the standard Pebble Watchface tutorial by adding a text at the top and buttom of the screen. There is also an Android app available to change the text on the watch from the phone.

This repo is managed through CloudPebble and there is a [blog post](http://blog.tritsch.org/2014/12/x-mas-project-1-pebble-hello-world-20.html) with some screenshots in it.
